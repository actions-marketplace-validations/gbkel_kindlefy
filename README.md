## üìå Overview

That's a way to automatically sync data with your kindle, such as RSS feeds, manga, and too much more.

## üé© Getting Started

This repository is a Github Action so you can configure a cron job with Github Actions to run it and sync the contents with your kindle in the way to prefer.

Below you can see an example of a configuration yaml that syncs contents with kindle every day at midnight *(be aware to pass the sender credentials as github secrets to avoid exposing it to the public)*:

```yml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

jobs:
  kindlefy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Sync kindle contents.
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Kindlefy
        uses: gbkel/kindlefy@v1.3.5
        with:
          kindle_email: 'test@kindle.com'
          sender: '[{ "type": "gmail", "email": "test@gmail.com", "password": "password" }]'
          sources: '[{ "type": "manga", "name": "One Piece" }, { "type": "rss", "url": "https://dev.to/feed" }]'
          storage: '[{ "type": "local", "githubAccessToken": "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" }]'
          no_duplicated_sync: true
```

### Sender

We recommend you to create a new email to use as a sender since some services need to disable extra auth in other to be able to send emails by smtp.

For now we have the current senders available:

**Gmail**

In order to use Gmail, you need to [Disable Unlock Captcha](https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha), Disable Two Factor Auth, [Enable Less Secure Apps Access](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps).

```json
{
	"type": "gmail",
	"email": "youremail@gmail.com",
	"password": "yourpassword"
}
```

**Outlook**

```json
{
	"type": "outlook",
	"email": "youremail@outlook.com",
	"password": "yourpassword"
}
```

**SMTP**

```json
{
	"type": "smtp",
	"email": "youremail@mail.com",
	"host": "host",
	"user": "user",
	"password": "password",
	"port": "port"
}
```

### Source

All the sources has some basic options to customize it during import. You are able to see these options below:

```json
{
	// Documents order. This value can be "desc" or "asc".
	"order": "desc",
	// Amount of documents to be sync.
	"count": 1
}
```

For now we have the following sources available to import contents to kindle *(the contents usually come in descending creation order)*:

**Manga**

The manga source by default sets ```count: 1``` and ```order: desc``` to retrieve the last most recent chapter.

```json
{
	"type": "manga",
	"name": "some manga name"
}
```

**RSS**

The RSS source by default sets ```order: desc``` and ```splitRSSPosts: false``` to return all posts in publish date descending order.

```json
{
	"type": "rss",
	"url": "url",
	// Set to true if you want every post to be a new document inside your kindle.
	"splitRSSPosts": false
}
```

### Storage

In case you want to avoid duplicated sync, you can use a storage to save sync history. After adding a storage config, you need to set the 'no_duplicated_sync' environment variable to true in order to use it. Currently we have the following storages:

**Local**

It saves the sync history inside the repository this action is currently running on. You need to give Kindlefy a github access token in order to edit the repository, usually when we are using a Github Action, it automatically sets up a variable called 'GITHUB_TOKEN' on the build context that can be used as shown in the .yml example in the start of the readme.

```json
{
	"type": "local",
	"githubAccessToken": "github access token"
}
```
